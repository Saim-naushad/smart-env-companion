Follow these steps to set up and run the temperature sensor script on your Raspberry Pi.

STEP 1

# Create the main project directory
mkdir -p ~/temperature-project
cd ~/temperature-project

#copy the entire temperature reading folder into your directory from GitHub by cloning.

# Navigate into the Temperature Reading folder
cd "Temperature Reading"

STEP 2

# Create a virtual environment in this folder
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

STEP 3

# Install the required libraries
pip install adafruit-blinka adafruit-circuitpython-mcp9808

STEP 4

# Make sure you're in the "Temperature Reading" folder
# and the virtual environment is activated
# (You should see (venv) at the start of your command prompt)

# Run the script
python temp_reader.py

You should see readings every 60 seconds

Important Notes:
The script will create a JSON file at ~/temperature.json with the latest reading
To stop the script, press Ctrl+C
You must activate the virtual environment each time you open a new terminal before running the script:
bash
Copy code
cd ~/temperature-project/"Temperature Reading"
source venv/bin/activate
